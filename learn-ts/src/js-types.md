- JS already has 7 primitive types:
  - string -> sequence of characters
  - number -> floating point is the only number type
  - bigint -> for huge numbers 
  - boolean -> logical data type with 2 values
  - undefined -> assigned to variables that have just been declared.
  - symbol -> unique values
  - null -> points to nonexistant object or address

- there are alos primtiive wrapper objects:
  - String -> for the string primitive 
  - Number -> for the number primitive 

- .toUpperCase() extends to string object, new String("") is a object type.
- while wriitng js we have to consider a lot of things:
  - is the function callable ?
  - does the function return anything ?
  - what are the arguments of the function ?
  - what does the format does argument accept ?
  
- ts can prevent us from making these mistakes in the first place by knowing we are accessing the right propertiesand passing the right arguments alongside code completion.
